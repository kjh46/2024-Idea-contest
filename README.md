## 🚀 AI-Based Coastal Route Optimization System  
### **1️⃣ Destination Input**  
- The user (ship) inputs current location and destination  

### **2️⃣ Optimal Route Search**  
- 📌 Uses **A* Algorithm, Potential Field Algorithm, and PINN-FEM Hybrid AI Model**  

### **3️⃣ Real-Time Environment Adaptation**  
- 📌 Adjusts routes based on external forces (wind, waves, currents) using **PINN + FEM**

## 🧠 Optimization Algorithms  
🔹 **A\* Algorithm**  
- **Pathfinding optimization**  
- Considers **various weights to find the most efficient path**  
- **Can reroute to avoid obstacles (hazards, traffic, etc.)**  

🔹 **Potential Field Algorithm**  
- Uses **electromagnetic field concept** for obstacle avoidance  
- **Keeps ships away from hazardous areas while maintaining optimal routes**  
- **Responds dynamically to environmental changes (currents, wind, etc.)**  

🔹 **PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Networks)**
- AI model trained **with physical constraints**
- Predicts **wave, wind, and ocean current effects on ship navigation**
- **Improves model robustness under dynamic maritime conditions**  

🔹 **FEM (Finite Element Method)**
- Simulates **fluid dynamics and ship interactions with external forces**
- **Provides detailed physical accuracy to improve AI decision-making**
- **Compensates for PINN’s limitations in high-variability maritime conditions**
