## 🚀 AI-Based Coastal Route Optimization System  
### **1️⃣ Destination Input**  
- The user (ship) inputs current location and destination  

### **2️⃣ Optimal Route Search**  
- 📌 Uses **A* Algorithm & Potential Field Algorithm** for route optimization  

### **3️⃣ Real-Time Environment Adaptation**  
- 📌 Adjusts routes based on external forces (wind, waves, currents)

## 🧠 Optimization Algorithms  
🔹 **A* Algorithm**  
- **Pathfinding optimization**  
- Considers **various weights to find the most efficient path**  
- **Can reroute to avoid obstacles (hazards, traffic, etc.)**  

🔹 **Potential Field Algorithm**  
- Uses **electromagnetic field concept** for obstacle avoidance  
- **Keeps ships away from hazardous areas while maintaining optimal routes**  
- **Responds dynamically to environmental changes (currents, wind, etc.)**  

📌 **Optimal Route Search Example:**  
| **A* Algorithm Pathfinding** | **Potential Field Algorithm Applied** |
